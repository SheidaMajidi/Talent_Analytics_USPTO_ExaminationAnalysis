### Innovating Patent Analytics:  Harnessing AI & Behavioral Sciences to Transform USPTO Operations 

Objectives: This project sets out to enhance the USPTO's efficiency and fairness in patent processing.  

Our goals include: 
- Conducting a detailed empirical analysis to understand how factors like gender, race, and ethnicity influence patent review times and examiner attrition at the USPTO. 
- Identifying key research questions regarding the duration of patent prosecutions and the factors contributing to examiner turnover. 
- Assessing the effectiveness of current analytics tools, especially those incorporating generative AI and behavioral science, in overcoming the identified challenges. 
- Formulating practical recommendations to improve patent processing speed and reduce biases.
